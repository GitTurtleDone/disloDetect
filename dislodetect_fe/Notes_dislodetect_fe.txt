When copying files to the "public" folder, in the react app project, the whole app will refresh
when display images in React, the files should be stored either in the "public" folder or in the "src" folder
The work-around implementation is to use: URL.createObjectURL(e.target.files[0]), i.e., 
creating an URL for the image file and use that URL as for src prop of the "img" element
